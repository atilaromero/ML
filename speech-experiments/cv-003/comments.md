Experiment cv-003 also uses a source code based on  experiment v-002, but the inclusion of items on the training sample was done gradually. Given that in cv-001 it was observed that training the vowels first improved training time, in experiment cv-003 the initial training dataset included only the vowels first. Then, a new item was added to the training set each time the loss was less than a certain threshold. This was implemented in Keras using a ``fit\_generator'' function and callbacks.

It was noticed that the value of the loss threshold to trigger the increase of training data has an important impact on the overall training time. But none of the values tried, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.3, generated satisfactory results, as in all three cases the training was interrupted after one hour, as it presented a clear disadvantage when compared to the previous experiment, that finished in less than 10 minutes.
