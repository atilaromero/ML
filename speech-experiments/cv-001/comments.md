Experiment cv-001 is based on experiment v-001, but applied the model on a dataset of syllables consisting of a consonant followed by a vowel. It uses a stop condition of accuracy $>=$ 0.6.

The experiment took 3m52s to reach an accuracy of 0.6, but the loss presented stagnation after that.

However, it was observed that the reuse of the model already trained with only the vowels improved the training time. In the current experiment the same model trained in experiment v-001 was used as a starting point in experiment cv-001.
